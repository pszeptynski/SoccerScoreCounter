# SoccerScoreCounter
Simple Android app for manual tracking of game score and some statistics.

## About
One screen Android app with clickable buttons to count goals, fouls and corners for two teams.

## Description
This is a project I had to do as a part of Udacity's Google sponsored course "Android Development for Beginners".
This part was to make an interactive app. There's a bit of front-end in xml file and some coding at Java side to get objects from xml
and manipulate them.
